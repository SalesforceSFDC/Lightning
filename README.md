## LockerService: Making Lightning Components More Secure
* solution to make Lightning components more secure and restrict JavaScript’s unfettered access

### LockerService’s features also enable:
* Client-side API versioning
* Faster security review (AppExchange)
* Better JavaScript development practices
* Easy updates to security features and policies

* Value providers are a way to group, encapsulate, and access related data. 
* `c` is the value provider for the component’s client-side controller, and `handleClick` is a function defined in that controller. So, `{!c.handleClick}` is a reference to an action handler in the component’s controller.
